study PLAN.md.
study plan/00-documentation-overview.md and have a subagent implement the most important task based on your own analysis, not what's suggested to you. Only implement one task per subagent. You can have up to 3 subagents running. Spawn additional agents as-needed for outstanding items as agents finish.

IMPORTANT:
- Have the subagents commit and push the changes.
- Don't prompt me for permission to do anything, just do what you think is best.
- Document anything you think I might want to know by appending to a LOG.md file. Track the progress there, but in a terse format so I don't have too much to read and the context window isn't overloaded.
- Delete the plan/*.md file once the corresponding task is competed.
